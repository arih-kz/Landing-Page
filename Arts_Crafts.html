            In Karachi, markets historically sold <b>jewelry</b>, <b>ornaments</b>, <b>textiles</b>, <b>furniture</b>, <b>leather goods</b>, and other handmade items, reflecting their long-standing cultural presence. <b>Multan</b>, one of Pakistan's oldest regions, is known for its artisans who create or decorate traditional objects. <b>Camel skin</b> is used to produce lamps, while <b>camel bone</b> is used for jewelry and decorative pieces. <b>Wood crafts</b> and <b>blue pottery</b> are also commonly produced by artisans in the region. "<b>Multani Khussa</b>," a type of leather shoe, is crafted there as well.

            In <b>Hyderabad, Sindh</b>, artisans produce <b>wooden furniture</b>, <b>sports goods</b>, and <b>embroidery items</b>. <b>Sillanwali</b>, a town in Punjab, is known for its <b>woodworking handicrafts</b>, including jars made from wooden candy and other traditional containers. "<b>Matki</b>" earthen pots are handicrafts associated with <b>Rawalpindi</b> and <b>Islamabad</b>, where they are commonly used and crafted. The <b>Ralli quilt</b>, a traditional blanket, is created by Sindhi artisans using simple tools.

            Pakistani <b>clay molding</b> dates back to the <b>British Raj</b>, particularly in the "Leh Nullah" region, where artisans created clay utensils. However, this tradition has largely disappeared. Before the <b>Partition of India</b>, clay utensils were produced and sold at the banks of the river "Leh Nullah" by Hindu artisans who later migrated to India.

            <b>Truck art</b> is a prominent traditional technique used to decorate vehicles like trucks and rickshaws with <b>poetic calligraphy</b>. Although this practice dates back to before the 1950s, it gained recognition in the 1970s when foreign tourists visited Pakistan and were captivated by the heavily painted trucks and buses. Though less common today, truck art originated in Punjab.

            The <b>handicrafts sector</b> in Pakistan is not a significant contributor to <b>economic development</b>, likely due to a lack of <b>international marketing</b> assistance and <b>legislative attention</b>. According to media reports, the crafts industry generates approximately <b>$255 million annually</b>, making it a low-earning business compared to other sectors. However, it plays a crucial role in <b>rural areas</b>, particularly among women who produce various crafts. The Government of Pakistan has stated that the handicrafts business has played a vital role in the economy over the past 15 years, with <b>furniture</b> and <b>textiles</b> being key crafts from Sindh and Punjab.
