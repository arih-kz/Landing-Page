        The <b>Cholistan Desert</b>, part of the western <b>Thar Desert</b>, shows evidence of <b>Indus Valley culture</b> that once used the <b>Hakra River</b> for agriculture. Derawar Fort is the best-preserved structure of several ancient forts in the area.
       </p>
       <p class="para">
        Built in the <b>9th century AD</b> by <b>Rai Jajja Bhati</b>, a Hindu Rajput ruler, the fort was originally named <b>Dera Rawal</b> and later renamed <b>Derawar</b>. In the <b>18th century</b>, the fort was taken over by the <b>Nawabs of Bahawalpur</b>, renovated in <b>1732</b> by <b>Nawab Sadeq Muhammad</b>, and briefly lost and regained by <b>Nawab Mubarak Khan</b>. The fort was later used by the <b>British</b> to house prisoners. <b>Google Doodle</b> celebrated Derawar Fort on Pakistan's Independence Day, symbolizing Pakistani adaptability and antiquity.

       <p class="para">
        Derawar Fort is a large square structure built of <b>clay bricks</b>, with a length of <b>1500 meters</b> and a height of up to <b>30 meters</b>. It features forty <b>circular bastions</b>, ten on each side, each intricately decorated. The interior includes <b>tile</b> and <b>fresco artwork</b>.
       </p>
       <p class="para">
        Renovated in <b>1732</b> and recently earmarked for conservation with <b>Rs46 million</b> by the provincial government, major work has included the conservation of a <b>food grain warehouse</b>, underpinning damaged parts, and repair of the fortâ€™s structure. Despite these efforts, the site faces deterioration due to severe weather and neglect.
       </p>
       <p class="para">
        Access to Derawar requires permission from the privately owned <b>Abbasi Family</b>. It is visited annually by over <b>70,000 people</b> during the <b>Cholistan Desert jeep rally</b>. The fort was submitted for consideration as a <b>World Heritage Site</b> in <b>2016</b> for its significance in ancient trade routes and architectural adaptation to the desert environment.
