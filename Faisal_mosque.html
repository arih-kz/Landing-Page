        A <b>major tourist attraction in Pakistan</b>, the mosque is a contemporary and influential piece of <b>Islamic architecture</b>. Construction began in 1976 after a $28 million grant from <b>Saudi King Faisal</b>. The unconventional design by <b>Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay</b> was selected after an international competition. The mosque is shaped like a Bedouin tent, surrounded by <b>four 260 feet (79 m) tall minarets</b>. The design features eight-sided shell-shaped sloping roofs forming a triangular worship hall that can hold 10,000 worshippers.
       </p>
       <p class="para">
        The structure covers an area of <b>33 acres</b> (1,400,000 sq ft) and dominates the landscape of Islamabad. It is situated at the north end of <b>Faisal Avenue</b>, at the foot of Margalla Hills. <b>Faisal Mosque</b> was the largest mosque in the world from 1986 until 1993. The initiative began in 1966 when <b>King Faisal</b> supported the Pakistani Government's plan to build a national mosque. In 1969, an international competition saw architects from 17 countries submit 43 proposals. The winning design was by <b>Vedat Dalokay</b>. Construction was led by <b>National Construction Limited of Pakistan</b> and funded by the Saudi government, at a cost of over <b>130 million Saudi riyals</b> (approximately 120 million USD today).
       </p>
       <p class="para">
        <b>King Faisal</b> was instrumental in the funding, and both the mosque and the road leading to it were named after him following his assassination in 1975. The first prayer was held on 18 June 1988, although the mosque was completed in 1986. The mosque grounds also housed the <b>International Islamic University</b> until it relocated in 2000. The design initially faced criticism from some traditional Muslims for its unconventional design and lack of a traditional dome structure. <b>Faisal Mosque</b> can accommodate about <b>300,000 worshippers</b>. Each of the four minarets is <b>79 m (230 ft) high</b> and 10Ã—10 meters in circumference. The main areas can hold up to <b>74,000 people</b>, and the surrounding grounds can contain up to <b>200,000 people</b>.

        <b>Architecture</b>: "I tried to capture the spirit, proportion, and geometry of <b>Kaaba</b> in a purely abstract manner. Imagine the apex of each of the four minarets as a scaled explosion of the four highest corners of Kaaba. An unseen Kaaba form is bounded by the minarets in a proportion of height to base. <b>Shah Faisal Mosque</b> is akin to the <b>Holy Kaaba</b> in the designer's eyes. Joining the apex of each minaret to the base of the diagonally opposite minaret forms a four-sided pyramid within an invisible cube. The lower level pyramid is treated as a solid body while the minarets' apexes complete the imaginary cube of <b>Kaaba</b>."

       <p class="para">
        <b>Faisal Mosque</b> close-up view: Instead of traditional domes, Vedat Dalokay designed an <b>eight-sided main hall</b> resembling a Bedouin desert tent. Four minarets, inspired by Turkish architecture, are placed at the corners of the main hall, each <b>80 m (260 ft) high</b>, making them the tallest in South Asia. The main structure is the prayer hall, supported by four concrete girders. The mosque still houses a library, lecture hall, museum, and cafe. The interior of the hall is covered in <b>white marble</b> and decorated with mosaics and calligraphy by the famous Pakistani artist <b>Sadequain</b>. The <b>Qibla Wall</b> is adorned with blue and white calligraphic tiles by Turkish artist <b>Mengu Ertel</b>. The mosque combines contemporary and classic <b>Islamic architecture</b>. The design elements are inspired by a <b>Bedouin tent</b>, while the minarets are influenced by Ottoman styles.

        <b>Faisal Mosque</b> from the Margalla Hills: Located at the foot of the <b>Margalla Hills</b>, the location plays a significant role. The mosque is visible from miles away and sits on a higher surface compared to the city, facing the city with a scenic backdrop of green mountains. <b>Faisal Avenue</b> leads straight to the mosque, showing its importance as a landmark. The shining white color contrasts with the dark green background, making the mosque stand out and highlight its significance to <b>Islamabad</b>.
