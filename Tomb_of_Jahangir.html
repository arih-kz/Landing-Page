            The tomb was built in <b>Jahangir's pleasure garden</b>, the <b>Dilkusha Garden</b>, which had been laid out in <b>1557</b>. The <b>Tomb of Asif Khan</b> and the <b>Akbari Sarai</b> are located immediately west of Jahangir's tomb complex. The tomb of Jahangir's wife <b>Nur Jahan</b> is slightly southwest of Asif Khan's tomb.

            <b>Jahangir</b>, who ruled from <b>1605 to 1627</b>, died in <b>Kashmir</b> on <b>28 October 1627</b>. His body was brought to Lahore on <b>12 November 1627</b>, and he was buried in the <b>Dilkusha Garden</b>, a favorite spot of his. His son, <b>Shah Jahan</b>, ordered the construction of the mausoleum in a <b>Mughal style</b> influenced by <b>Safavid architecture</b>. The tomb is unique in that it lacks a central dome, which Jahangir reportedly forbade.

        <p class="para">
            Construction started in <b>1627</b>, took ten years, and cost <b>Rs 10 Lakh</b>. The tomb complex was desecrated and pillaged under <b>Sikh rule</b>, with materials used for the <b>Golden Temple</b> in <b>Amritsar</b>. Further desecration occurred when <b>Musa Sahib</b> was buried on the tomb's grounds in <b>1828</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            The site suffered further damage under <b>British rule</b> when a railway line was built between the tombs of <b>Asif Khan</b> and <b>Nur Jahan</b>. The site has also been repeatedly threatened by <b>flooding</b> from the <b>Ravi River</b>, notably in <b>1988</b> when the site was submerged under <b>10 feet of water</b> for five days.
